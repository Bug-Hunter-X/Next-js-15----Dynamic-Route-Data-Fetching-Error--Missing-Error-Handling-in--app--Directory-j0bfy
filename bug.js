In Next.js 15, an uncommon error can occur when using the `app` directory's new features, specifically with dynamic routes and data fetching.  If you have a route like `/product/[id]`, and the `id` isn't handled correctly within your `app/product/[id]/page.js` file (e.g., missing error handling for cases where the `id` doesn't correspond to an existing product), it can lead to unexpected behavior. This might manifest as a blank page, a cryptic error message, or even the app crashing in edge cases.  The error is not always clear from the console logs, leading to more time spent debugging.  

Example problematic code (page.js):
```javascript
import {getProduct} from '@/services/product';

export default async function ProductPage({params}){
  const product = await getProduct(params.id);
  // No error handling if getProduct fails or returns null
  return <div>Product: {product.name}</div>;
}
```
