# Next.js 15 Dynamic Route Error: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when fetching data within dynamically generated routes located within the `app` directory.

## The Problem
When working with dynamic routes (e.g., `/product/[id]`) in Next.js 15's `app` directory and fetching data based on route parameters, inadequate error handling can result in unexpected behavior.  Without proper checks for missing data or API errors, the application might display a blank page or even crash without providing clear error messages.

## Reproducing the Error
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug` directory.
3. Try to access a route with a `productId` that doesn't exist in the mock data.  Observe the lack of error handling and the unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution` directory demonstrates the corrected code with proper error handling implemented, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly experience.
